# Static Files
Static files that we use for metadata.

## Notes
- Feel free to add any desired basin associations, they just need to be comma separated. Note that all current software searches for exact, case sensitive matches.
- Basin definitions should match across files, i.e. it should be 'West Central' in both `iddco_sites_metadata.csv` and `id_reservoirs_metadata.csv`.
